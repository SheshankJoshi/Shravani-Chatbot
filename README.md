# Shravani-Chatbot
A Bot that prevents Industrial Disasters


This is the chatbot I have done for my capstone project. This is ready for deployment as it is, but requires a little debugging to make it run smoothly, particularly the JavaScript part, which I am not very good at.

The Scope of this project can be expanded with inclusion of speech-to-text conversion mechanism, added with Transformer enabled automatic translation of the description of an incident. The core of 
the project is still the Language model, but the expansion and integration is effected. 

I am currently working on the expansion part, particularly with Transformers, and have pushed the deployment part aside for now.

Please keep looking here for more changes.
